1. Test Encoding?
2. Timestamps?
3. Geo Locations?

Implemented:


Cleaning v1:

1. Checked if row length is not 6
	then concatenate with the next one	until an array with len6 comes!
	save bad ones in another file.

2. Added dummy User Id's for invalid user Id's. 
	We assume that regular users are logged properly and hence we have incorrect id's for new users.
